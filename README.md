# Task2
Creating a K-means Clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history
Description:
This project focuses on segmenting retail store customers based on their purchasing behavior using K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Using the Mall Customers dataset, I analyzed key features like Annual Income and Spending Score to group customers into meaningful clusters. The goal was to help businesses better understand different customer profiles and develop targeted marketing strategies.

Key Highlights:

Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k = 5)

Identified distinct customer groups such as high-income high-spenders, low-income low-spenders, etc.

Visualized clusters using Matplotlib for better interpretability

Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

Outcome:
Created actionable customer segments that can be used to drive personalized marketing, product recommendations, and improved customer experience.
